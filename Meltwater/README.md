Various Trials at Predicting various Metrics used by Meltwater like Predicted Reach, Advertisement Value Equivalent (AVEs) etc. 

The problem is highly complex as the Reach and other Metrics is something that is itself a prediction done by various other metrics internal to Meltwater Backend and the data provided is highly skewed towards 2018 onwards as there was a sudden change in query handling methods at the start of 2018 (visible in the notebook).

Initial trials were using XGBRegressor(Not recommended), just to get a feel of the problem and to make helper functions.
